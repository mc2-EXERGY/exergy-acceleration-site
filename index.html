        <h1>What if Faith is Not Just Believing, but Activating?</h1>
        <h2>Are You Ready to Step Into the Narrow Gate?</h2>
        
        <p><strong>"Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it." (Matthew 7:13-14)</strong></p>
        
        <p>Faith is more than belief. It is action. Exergy is the power God has already placed within youâ€”waiting to be awakened. If you have ever felt that you were meant for more, that you were called to something greater, you are not imagining it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The time has come to step into what He has been preparing you for.</strong></p>
        
        <p>"For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and a sound mind." (2 Timothy 1:7)</p>
